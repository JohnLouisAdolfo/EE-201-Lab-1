## About Me
Hello, I'm a second year Electrical and Computer Engineering major at the University of Washington. Although I go to school in Washington, I'm originally from the island of Maui, Hawaii. On my free time, I like to look for restaurants around Seattle that have delicious foods (and are affordable). I also like to play video games occasionally. The video game I'm playing the most right now is League of Legends, and I play Nunu & Willump. I look forward to meeting you all.
